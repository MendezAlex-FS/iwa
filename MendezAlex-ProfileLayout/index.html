          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Alex Mendez—a seasoned web developer with 20+ years of
            experience and director-level expertise. My focus now is to secure a
            stable, well-paying job that provides financial security and a
            comfortable retirement in about 15 years, prioritizing long-term
            career alignment and a safe location.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm pursuing a degree at Full Sail University to enhance my
            credentials. Over the next five years, I plan to re-enter web
            development at a mid-to-senior level and eventually launch a family
            property business to build financial stability and leave a lasting
            legacy for my loved ones.

        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>
          Traveling has broadened my perspective through diverse cultures,
          landscapes, and histories. From Hawaii to New York, each place has
          left its unique mark, while Kentucky and Georgia deepened my
          appreciation for regional traditions. International trips to South
          Africa and Germany offered insights into different cultures and
          histories. These experiences have fueled my curiosity, adaptability,
          and desire to explore new places. Travel has reinforced my
          appreciation for diversity and continued learning.

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
          What I love about technology is the creativity it fosters in both web
          development and building computers. Each project presents a new
          challenge to solve or a task to optimize, keeping the work fresh and
          exciting. No two websites are exactly the same, and each one presents
          unique nuances to address. Building PCs is particularly fascinating,
          as even small variations in components or assembly lead to distinct
          results, blending science with artistry. This unpredictability and
          precision make each build an engaging and rewarding experience.

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
          I appreciate different types of music, each offering something unique
          that suits my mood or the moment. Country is my favorite, with its
          heartfelt lyrics, storytelling, and emotional authenticity. I also
          enjoy a mix of reggaeton, R&B, slow rock, and blues, each providing
          distinct vibes—from reggaeton’s upbeat rhythm to R&B’s soulful vocals
          and blues’ expressive storytelling. A diverse playlist lets me switch
          between genres depending on my mood, making music an essential part of
          my life for both inspiration and relaxation.

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
          multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
          Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
          Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
          the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been
          free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
          customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>
          Cooking Gordon Ramsay’s lobster risotto is one of my favorite
          experiences. From preparing the lobster to achieving the perfect
          creamy risotto, the process is incredibly rewarding. The rich, buttery
          lobster combined with the flavors from the broth, wine, and parmesan
          creates a comforting yet elegant dish. I love the precision and
          patience required, especially when slowly stirring the rice to release
          its starch. It’s a dish that demands attention and technique, making
          it even more satisfying when it turns out perfectly.

        <h3>Fishing</h3>
        <p class="card-description">
          Fishing is more than a hobby—it’s a way to connect with myself and
          nature. The peacefulness of being near the water, combined with the
          rhythm of the waves, creates a meditative experience that allows me to
          be present. The patience and strategy involved offer both challenge
          and reward, and every trip is unique. Whether it's the quiet
          appreciation of nature or the excitement of a big catch, fishing gives
          me a sense of calm, clarity, and fulfillment. It reminds me to slow
          down and appreciate the simple things in life.
