            <strong>League of Legends (LoL)</strong>, commonly referred to as
            League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game
            developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the
            Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to
            develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in
            October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through
            purchasable character customization. The game is available for
            Microsoft Windows and macOS.

          <p>
            League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game
            in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of
            unique abilities from an isometric perspective.[2][3] As of 2024,
            there are 168 champions available to play.[4] Over the course of a
            match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP)
            through killing enemies.[5] Items can be acquired to increase
            champions' strength,[6] and are bought with gold, which players
            accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the
            opposing team's minions,[2] champions, or defensive
            structures.[5][6] In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are
            purchased through a shop menu available to players only when their
            champion is in the team's base.[2] Each match is discrete; levels
            and items do not transfer from one match to another.[7]

          <p>
            Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and
            the most prominent in professional-level play.[8][9][10] The mode
            has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a
            player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they
            can climb. There are ten tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze,
            and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and
            Challenger.[11][a]

          Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent
          game modes.
          <h3>ARAM & Teamfight Tactics</h3>
          <p>
            <em>ARAM</em> ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode
            like Summoner's Rift, but on a map called Howling Abyss with only
            one long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen
            for players.[23][24][25] Given the small size of the map, players
            must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.[26]
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> is an auto battler released in June 2019
            and made a permanent game mode the following month.[27][28] As with
            others in its genre, players build a team and battle to be the last
            one standing. Players do not directly affect combat but position
            their units on a board for them to fight automatically against
            opponents each round.[29] Teamfight Tactics is available for iOS and
            Android and has cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS
            clients.[30]
