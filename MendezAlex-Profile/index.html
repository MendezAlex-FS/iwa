      <p>
        Hello! My name is Alex Mendez. I am a highly experienced web development
        professional with over 20 years in the field, having reached a
        director-level position. While I’ve built a strong career in tech, my
        current focus is on securing a stable, well-paying job that will allow
        me to retire comfortably in about 15 years. Titles and prestige aren’t
        my priority—what matters most to me is financial security, a safe
        location, and a job that aligns with my long-term goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my tech career, I’m working toward a degree at Full Sail
        University, ensuring strong academic performance. My five-year plan
        includes entering the web development field at an mid-level to
        senior-level position, gaining hands-on experience, and gradually moving
        up to a higher-paying role with good benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I have entrepreneurial ambitions. I plan to start a
        family business in property, aiming for financial stability, business
        growth, and a legacy that benefits my family. I value meaningful
        connections, personal growth, and using my success to support my loved
        ones. Overall, I am strategic, driven, and focused on both professional
        and personal success—balancing career stability, financial security, and
        family aspirations.

      <h2 id="traveling">Traveling</h2>
      <p>
        Traveling has given me the opportunity to experience diverse cultures,
        landscapes, and histories, shaping my perspective in ways I never
        imagined. From the tropical beauty of Hawaii to the bustling streets of
        New York and LA, each place has left its mark on me. Washington DC and
        Virginia provided a deep dive into American history, while states like
        Kentucky and Georgia gave me a taste of the South’s rich traditions and
        hospitality. Whether exploring the deserts of Arizona or the coastal
        beauty of the Carolinas, each journey has broadened my appreciation for
        the different ways people live across the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the United States, my travels have taken me to incredible
        destinations like South Africa and Germany, where I was able to
        experience vastly different cultures and histories. South Africa’s
        vibrant energy and stunning landscapes were unforgettable, and I found
        its complex history both eye-opening and humbling. Germany, with its
        deep-rooted traditions and modern innovation, gave me a fascinating
        contrast of old and new. Walking through historic cities, learning about
        different cultures firsthand, and engaging with people from different
        backgrounds made these trips incredibly enriching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through all these travels, I’ve gained more than just memories—I’ve
        developed a greater sense of curiosity, adaptability, and understanding
        of the world. Every destination has offered a unique lesson, whether in
        the form of history, culture, or the simple joy of experiencing
        something new. Travel has reinforced my appreciation for diversity and
        deepened my desire to continue exploring new places, meeting new people,
        and learning from the world around me.
      </p>
      <h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
      <p>
        What I love about technology is the endless creativity it allows,
        whether I’m developing a website or building a computer. It never feels
        monotonous—there’s always a new challenge to tackle, a new problem to
        solve, or a new way to optimize something. Every project feels like a
        unique puzzle, where I get to piece things together in a way that best
        fits the needs of the task at hand. In web development, no two sites are
        exactly alike; even with similar frameworks or designs, there are always
        nuances that make each one distinct. The process of coding, debugging,
        and refining ensures that there’s always something new to learn, keeping
        the experience fresh and exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building PCs, in particular, is something that fascinates me because no
        two builds are ever truly identical. Even when using the same
        components, small variations in factors like thermal performance, power
        efficiency, or benchmarking results make each build a unique experience.
        The precision involved in assembling parts, optimizing airflow, and
        fine-tuning performance adds an element of craftsmanship that keeps me
        engaged. It’s a blend of science and artistry, where technical knowledge
        meets hands-on creativity. That unpredictability—where even a slight
        variation in assembly can change the outcome—makes every build an
        exciting and rewarding endeavor.
      </p>
      <h2 id="music">Music</h2>
      <p>
        I have a deep appreciation for different kinds of music, each offering
        something unique that resonates with me depending on my mood or the
        moment. Country music is my favorite because of its storytelling,
        heartfelt lyrics, and the way it captures raw emotions and real-life
        experiences. Whether it’s a classic country ballad or a modern hit, the
        authenticity of the genre speaks to me. The combination of rich vocals,
        acoustic melodies, and relatable themes makes it a genre I can always
        turn to, whether I want to relax, reminisce, or just enjoy a feel-good
        tune.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond country, I enjoy a mix of reggaeton, R&B, slow rock, and even
        some blues. Reggaeton brings an energy and rhythm that’s hard to resist,
        making it great for upbeat moments. R&B offers smooth vocals and deep,
        soulful emotions, perfect for unwinding. Slow rock carries a nostalgic
        and calming vibe, while blues captivates me with its expressive
        instrumentals and raw storytelling. I like having a diverse playlist
        because each genre brings its own vibe, allowing me to switch things up
        based on how I feel. Music, in all its forms, is an essential part of my
        life, providing both inspiration and relaxation.

      <h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
      <p class="margin-top-2rem">
        League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
        multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
        Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
        Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
        the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been
        free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
        customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
      </p>
      <h2 id="cooking">Cooking</h2>
      <p>
        Cooking Gordon Ramsay’s lobster risotto is one of my favorite culinary
        experiences. There’s something incredibly rewarding about the
        process—from carefully preparing the lobster to achieving the perfect
        creamy texture of the risotto. The balance of rich, buttery lobster with
        the depth of flavors from the broth, wine, and parmesan creates an
        elegant yet comforting dish. I enjoy the precision it requires, the
        patience needed to slowly stir the rice to release its starch, and the
        way each ingredient plays a role in building layers of flavor. It’s a
        dish that demands attention and technique, which makes it all the more
        satisfying when it turns out perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond just the taste, I love making lobster risotto because it feels
        like an elevated experience every time. It’s not just a meal; it’s a
        process that engages all the senses—the aroma of shallots and garlic
        sautéing, the rich seafood-infused broth simmering, and the vibrant
        colors of the finished dish. Whether I’m cooking it for myself as a
        treat or sharing it with others, it always feels special. There’s
        something about perfecting a dish crafted by a world-renowned chef like
        Gordon Ramsay that makes it even more enjoyable, pushing me to refine my
        cooking skills with every attempt.
      </p>
      <h2 id="fishing">Fishing</h2>
      <p>
        Fishing is more than just a hobby for me—it’s a way to connect with
        myself and the world around me. There’s something incredibly peaceful
        about being near the water, feeling the rhythm of the waves, and waiting
        patiently for a bite. The stillness and anticipation create a meditative
        experience where my mind, body, and soul align. In those moments,
        nothing else exists; the distractions of daily life fade away, leaving
        only the simple joy of being present. Whether I’m fishing alone or with
        others, it’s always a grounding experience that brings me a deep sense
        of calm and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the tranquility, fishing also gives me a sense of challenge and
        reward. The patience required, the strategy behind choosing the right
        bait, and the thrill of finally feeling a tug on the line make every
        trip exciting. No two fishing experiences are the same—sometimes it’s
        about the quiet appreciation of nature, while other times, it’s about
        the adrenaline of reeling in a big catch. Regardless of the outcome,
        fishing always leaves me refreshed, reminding me to slow down,
        appreciate the little things, and enjoy the connection between nature
        and myself.
